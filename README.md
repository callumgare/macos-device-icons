A quickly-written and very messy script to export a reference table of the all device icons in MacOS and the various device codes which match each icon.

The easiest way to view the resulting exported reference table is here: https://callumgare.github.io/macos-device-icons/

But if you want to run the script yourself first make sure zx is installed [zx](https://google.github.io/zx/) (`npm install -g zx`), then run:
```shell
generateMacosDeviceIconsReference.mjs /path/to/dir-to-export-files-to
```
